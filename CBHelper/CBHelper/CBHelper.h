 *
 * The cloudbase.io iOS helper class compiles to .a library. The project
 * needs to be part of your workspace and the CBHelper directory in your path for
 * additional includes.<br/><br/>
 * To be able to compile your application make sure that the "Other Linker Flags"
 * for the CBHelperTestApp target include the following two options:<br/>
 * -ObjC<br/>
 * -all_load<br/><br/>
 *
 * This full reference is a companion to <a href="/documentation/ios" target="_blank">
 * the tutorial on the cloudbase.io website<a/>
